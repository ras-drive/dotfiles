# My Dotfiles

These are my arch i3 desktop config files, I use this repo to sync my laptop and desktop machines.

if you'd like to run my setup you can clone this repo and use the install script
![my dracula themed i3 config](desktop.png "Desktop")

To install these files you can run the provided script, it installs packages and if needed, the Paru aur helper.
If you want a wallpaper to be set to restore on new sessions place a `wallpaper.png` file in your `~/.config` directory or the cloned repo before running the script
